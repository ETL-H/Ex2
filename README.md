# Ex2 Repository

## Overview
Hello, my name is Itiel Halevi, and this is my second assignment for Ariel University. This project is about creating a spreadsheet application that allows users to store and manipulate information. The spreadsheet supports cells referencing each other, detects errors, and identifies cyclic dependencies (referred to as "cycle errors").

## Project Structure
- `.idea/` - Contains project metadata and configuration files for IntelliJ IDEA.
- `lib/` - Includes external libraries and dependencies required for the project.
- `src/` - The main source code directory, which contains the implementation of the project's features and logic.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git.
- `Ex2.iml` - IntelliJ IDEA-specific project configuration file.

## Code Overview
The source code for this project is organized as follows:

1. **Main Class**:
   - The entry point of the program, responsible for initializing the spreadsheet and managing user interactions.

2. **Spreadsheet Logic**:
   - Core functionality for managing cells, including adding, updating, and deleting data.
   - Handles cell references and ensures data consistency.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Detects and manages errors such as invalid inputs and cyclic dependencies between cells (cycle errors).

4. **Utilities**:
   - Helper classes and methods for common operations, such as parsing cell references and validating input.

5. **Testing**:
   - Includes unit tests and example scenarios to verify spreadsheet functionality, such as error detection and reference resolution.
